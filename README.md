## üß† Overview

This blockchain system implements a **proof-of-work (PoW)** consensus model.  
Each node maintains its own copy of the ledger. Blocks contain verified transactions and cryptographic hashes linking them together, ensuring immutability and integrity.

Key Features:

- RESTful API for blockchain access
- Transaction creation and validation
- Proof-of-Work mining mechanism
- Persistent JSON storage
- Modular architecture with ~90 `.js` files across 9 folders
- Easily extensible for P2P networking, wallets, and smart contracts

---

- **Express Layer** ‚Äî Handles HTTP requests and routes.
- **Core Layer** ‚Äî Implements blockchain logic.
- **Service Layer** ‚Äî Logging, validation, and persistence utilities.
- **Data Layer** ‚Äî Stores blocks and transactions in local JSON files.
- **Config Layer** ‚Äî Defines network settings, difficulty, and mining reward.
